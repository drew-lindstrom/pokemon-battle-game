Gen 6 End Turn Sequence

Generation VI
Events with the same number are either mutually exclusive and/or apply to each relevant Pokémon from fastest to slowest. Unlike movement order, the order in which Pokémon are selected is based on their current Speed rather than their Speed at the start of the turn. The order it is applied to individual Pokémon is reversed by Trick Room.

Block A
Each individual Pokémon performs these effects in this order (all applicable ones are done before the next Pokémon does), with faster Pokémon doing them first. Unlike movement order, the order in which Pokémon are selected is based on their current Speed rather than their Speed at the start of the turn. Once a Pokémon has started a block, it finishes the block even if its Speed changes within the block (e.g. being cured of paralysis). The order it is applied to individual Pokémon is reversed by Trick Room.

Block B
Each individual Pokémon performs these effects in this order (all applicable ones are done before the next Pokémon does), with faster Pokémon doing them first. Unlike movement order, the order in which Pokémon are selected is based on their current Speed rather than their Speed at the start of the turn. Once a Pokémon has started a block, it finishes the block even if its Speed changes within the block (e.g. Speed Boost). The order it is applied to individual Pokémon is reversed by Trick Room, including during the turn Trick Room wore off.
